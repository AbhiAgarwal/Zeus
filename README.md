My attempt at a Personal Assistant using Node.JS and Java (Sphinx4). Sphinx4 is used for speech recognition and speech synthesis and then processed through to Node.JS running on a server. 

To run:

    - Run the Node.JS server, to run:
        - node zeus.js

    - compile sphinx4 code, and run:
        - java -mx256m -jar bin/FlatVoiceCommands.jar
